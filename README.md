# C-Program-to-Determine-Pass-or-Fail-Based-on-Marks
This C program determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their marks in three subjects. To pass, the student must score at least 33% in each subject and a total of 40% overall. The program takes input from the user, calculates the total percentage, and displays the result accordingly.
